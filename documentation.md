# Furry Programming Language

## Fuctions.
- **Scream**: Use this fuction when you want to show something in the terminal: Scream "Hello fluffy world!". Remember to use quotes to show text.
- **Wait**: This function pauses the execution of the code for the amount of time established, before executing the code under it: Wait 2. This function only admits whole numbers, not decimal.
- **Hurray_End**: Show the Hit! (a97000), use it when you want to check your code runs okay.
- **7u7**: A one line comment.
- **Protogen** This is a somewhat technical functions library to perform operations and tabajos with numbers.
    - **Protogen.Plus(x, y)** Make a sum with the numbers that are introduced. 
    - **Protogen.Minus(x, y)** Make a subtraction with the numbers that are introduced 
    - **Protogen.Times(x, y)** Make a multiplication with the numbers that are introduced
    - **Protogen.DivBy(x, y)** Make a division with the numbers that are introduced

## Alerts.
- **"Hit! (a97000): The code is executed successfully!"** - This alert means that the code was executed without errors.
- **"Hit! (a97001): The file is not a .furro file!"** - This alert means that the file you are triying to execute with Furro Interpreter, its not a furro file (exaple.furro).

## Errors.
- **"Damn! (x0000): What the hell means 'A_worng_fuction' ?"** - This error appears if you write a function badly or if you wrote a function that does not exist in language. 
- **"Damn! (x0001): Are you trying to scream in the wrong way!"** - It means, you are writing a wrong syntax of the function Scream, check you are using "" like: Scream "Hello fluffy world!". If you are trying to use this function to show a number, it is possible that this error appears too.
- **"Damn! (x0002): You can't wait fractionally or decimal little fox."** - It means, that you re trying to use Wait fuction with a decimal number like 1.5, Wait fuction only runs with integer numbers like 1.
